# HTTP Threat Blocklist

This repository provides a **daily-updated blocklist** of IP addresses involved in malicious HTTP attacks targeting servers. Designed to protect both your systems and mine, the blocklist defends against common HTTP-based threats, including **probing**, **exploit attempts**, and **malicious bots**.

## 🔍 About This List

This is my **private blocklist**, built from traffic that actually made it through multiple layers of defense — including **Cloudflare**, **CrowdSec**, and IP rate limits. I also block entire regions like **China** and **Russia**, so if something shows up here, it means it **slipped through all of that** and still tried something shady.

*In short: this list catches the ones that got further than they should have.*
